# Credit Card Fraud Detection 

## Dataset
The dataset for this project can be found on [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud/data) under Database Contents License (DbCL) v1.0.

The authors of this dataset collected credit card transactions from two days in September 2013 by European cardholders. The dataset consists of 284 807 transactions of which 492 were fraudulent, making this dataset imbalanced as only 0.17% of transactions are fraudulent.

Due to confidentiality, the authors of the dataset could not provide the original features and additional background information. Therefore, the 28 of the 30 variables are the principal components obtained using PCA. The two variables *Time* and *Amount* were the only variables that were not transformed with PCA. *Time* refers to the time elapsed between the given transaction and the first transaction in the dataset. *Amount* refers to the transaction amount.

## Objectives
The main objective of this project is:
> To develop a system that will be able to detect whether a transaction is fraudulent

To achieve this objective, it was further broken down into the following four technical sub-objectives:
1. To perform an exploratory data analysis
2. To clean the data where possible
3. To use oversampling methods to address the problem of imbalanced classes.
4. To develop supervised models to classify the nature of the card transaction on both the balanced and imbalanced data.

## Main Insights
Limited exploratory data analysis was done due to the nature of the dataset, :
- Insight 1...
- Insight 2...

## Data Cleaning and Engineered Features
Due to the nature of the dataset no additional features were engineered, however there were 1 081 duplicate transactions. The duplicated transaction were removed from the dataset before model selection.
